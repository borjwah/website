<i class='fas fa-peace'></i>borjwah is a music project created by Anthony Cofield with the intention of merging political activism with electronic dance music by combining different sounds from various genres and pairing them with visuals that have meaning. The project takes a far-leftist perspective with democratic socialists themes throughout the artwork and is part of a core message.
