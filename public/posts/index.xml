<h4 id="the-vital-synth-has-been-a-game-changer-and-gem-in-the-studio">The Vital synth has been a game changer and gem in the studio!</h4>
<p>Now I&rsquo;m releasing the first preset pack for free! It consists of 10 presets and also includes the preset that is discussed in the tutorial below. The idea behind this pack was to create some basic supersaw presets that you can use either as is, as a template or even layer or customize to fit the sound your looking for. They have different sonic and tonal qualities to fit different production styles. I hope this pack helps you on you next production! I have more packs planned and if you have any requests or ideas feel free to let me know!</p>
<p>Solidarity!</p>

<h4 id="welcome-comrade">Welcome Comrade,</h4>
<p>I hope this message reaches you and your family well and in good health! I&rsquo;ve been planning on creating a website for some time now to go along with the YouTube channel and &ldquo;borjwah&rdquo; project at large. I&rsquo;ve always had this idea of merging political activism and electronic dance music. EDM as many of tunes are instrumental and/or minimal vocals that I see as a canvas for raising awareness to important issues across the globe. I want to use this project as a way to help unite people through music and uplift each other to become better artists and better human beings.</p>
<p>I plan to use this channel as a starting point to post updates about where the project is currently and where it&rsquo;s going (new music, tutorials, free downloads, and software development stuff). I want to use this platform as a way to help support and uplift the music production community and ultimately transcend into a scope that can help the world community at large.</p>
