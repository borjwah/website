# Supersaw Preset Pack for Vital

#### The Vital synth has been a game changer and gem in the studio! 

Now I'm releasing the first preset pack for free! It consists of 10 presets and also includes the preset that is discussed in the tutorial below. The idea behind this pack was to create some basic supersaw presets that you can use either as is, as a template or even layer or customize to fit the sound your looking for. They have different sonic and tonal qualities to fit different production styles. I hope this pack helps you on you next production! I have more packs planned and if you have any requests or ideas feel free to let me know! 

Solidarity!
